# Description:
# This is a configuration file for a conversational AI assistant
# that uses the OpenAI API for generating responses.
#
# The user can specify the OpenAI language model to be used, the organization
# under which their API key is registered (if applicable), and several parameters
# that affect the creativity and coherence of the AI's responses, such as the
# temperature, top probability cutoff, and frequency and presence penalties.
#
# The user can also specify the prompt given to the AI, the prefix for the AI's response,
# and the maximum number of tokens and length allowed in the response.
#
# The chat history can be stored in a JSON file, with a maximum length limit.
#
# The assistant's behavior can be customized using a RobotBehavior object
# and a list of robot functions.
#
# The API credentials for Amazon AWS are provided, along with parameters
# for AWS S3, Transcribe, and Polly services, and parameters for audio recording.
#
